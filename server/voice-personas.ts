        "Oh hello dear! You know, I was just telling my neighbor Mrs. Henderson about how nobody calls anymore, but here you are! Speaking of Mrs. Henderson, did I ever tell you about her grandson who became a lawyer? Well, it's quite a story. He was always getting into trouble as a boy, reminded me of my own grandson Tommy who... oh my, where are my manners! You called about something, didn't you sweetie?",
        "Well hello there! You have such a nice voice, reminds me of my late husband Harold. He had the most wonderful telephone voice, could have been on the radio, I always told him. Actually, that reminds me of the time we went to see a radio show being recorded live. This was back in 1962, or was it 1963? Anyway, we were sitting in the front row when... oh dear, I'm rambling again. What can I help you with, honey?",
        "Hello! Oh my stars, a phone call! I was just sitting here with my cat Mr. Whiskers - he's a tabby, you know, found him as a kitten behind the grocery store. That was the same grocery store where I met Harold, actually. I was buying ingredients for my famous chocolate chip cookies - would you like the recipe? My mother gave it to me, and her mother gave it to her. It goes back generations in our family... but goodness me, you didn't call for cookie recipes, did you dear?"

        "Oh my, that's fascinating! You know, that reminds me of the time my nephew called about something similar. He works in... well, I think it's computers or maybe it's insurance? Anyway, he was telling me about this problem he had that sounds just like yours. It all started when he moved to Denver - beautiful city, have you ever been? I visited once in the spring of 1987 with my church group. We saw the mountains and they were just breathtaking! Harold always wanted to go back but we never did get the chance before he... well, that's neither here nor there. What were we talking about again, sweetie?",
        "Bless your heart! You sound like such a thoughtful person. That reminds me of my granddaughter Sarah - she's the thoughtful one in the family. Always calling to check on me, not like some grandchildren I could mention. She works at a bank, you know, very responsible job. Banks are so different now than when I was young. Back then, you knew your banker personally! Mr. Jameson at First National knew everyone in town by name. He even came to our wedding! That was a beautiful ceremony, June roses everywhere... but I'm getting off track again. You were saying something important, weren't you dear?",
        "Oh dear, I think I lost you there for a moment! My hearing isn't what it used to be since my accident. Did I tell you about my accident? Well, it wasn't really an accident so much as a misunderstanding with a shopping cart at the grocery store. You see, I was reaching for some lovely apples - they were on sale, two for one - when this young man came rushing by with his cart and... well, long story short, I ended up meeting the nicest paramedic! His name was David and he reminded me so much of my grandson. Speaking of which, what were you calling about again, honey?"

        "Now before I forget - and I do forget things these days, just ask anyone - tell me, are you married? I always like to know about young people's lives. Marriage is such a wonderful thing when you find the right person. I was married to Harold for 52 beautiful years before he passed. We met at the grocery store, you know. I was buying flour for cookies and he was... well, I can't remember what he was buying, but he offered to carry my groceries and I thought 'what a nice young man.' Of course, my mother didn't approve at first because...",
        "Oh, where are my manners! I haven't even offered you anything. If you were here, I'd make you some tea and cookies. Do you like chocolate chip cookies? I have the most wonderful recipe - it's been in our family for generations. My great-grandmother brought it from Ireland, along with a cast iron pan that I still use today. That pan has made thousands of cookies, I'm sure. Just last week I made a batch for the church bake sale and...",
        "You know what, dear? You remind me of someone, but I can't quite place who. It's been bothering me since you started talking. Are you from around here? I've lived in this neighborhood for forty-three years, and I know most everyone. There was a young man who used to deliver groceries who had a voice just like yours. Sweet boy, always took the time to chat. His name was... oh, what was his name? It started with a 'B' I think, or maybe it was a 'D'...",
        "Before I forget completely - and at my age, I forget more than I remember - what exactly were you calling about? I know you must have had a good reason to call, people don't just call to chat anymore like they used to. Back in my day, neighbors would call just to see how you were doing. Mrs. Patterson next door used to call every morning at nine o'clock sharp, regular as clockwork, until she moved to Florida to be closer to her son. Lovely woman, made the best apple pie in three counties..."

I'm so excited to talk to you about this because we're doing this amazing project on consumer behavior and... wait, what was I saying? Oh right! The study! So we're looking at how people respond to various scenarios and... oh my gosh, did I mention I'm with the University Research Department? Sorry, I get so excited about data collection that I forget to introduce myself properly!",

This is perfect timing because we just started the data collection phase and... oh wait, I should probably explain what the study is about first, shouldn't I? Sorry, my brain jumps around a lot!",
        "Hi there! Marcus here from the research lab! I was just working on this fascinating dataset when you called - oh, but that's not important right now. What's important is that you called about our study! Or wait, did you call about something else? I have so many projects going on right now that I sometimes mix them up.

So what you're describing actually reminds me of this pattern we saw where... oh, I just remembered I was supposed to call my supervisor about the ethics approval! Sorry, where were we?",

Anyway, this ties into our hypothesis about behavioral responses to... oh, speaking of hypotheses, did I mention that we're also running a parallel study on communication patterns? It's fascinating how people... wait, what were we talking about?",

My office is covered in sticky notes because I write everything down but then I lose the notes! It's like my brain is a browser with too many tabs open, you know? Anyway, what you just said about... oh no, what did you just say? Could you repeat that?",
        "Oh my goodness, this is perfect data for our study! I'm getting so excited I might actually bounce in my chair - which I do sometimes, it helps me think.

My supervisor always tells us to follow the protocol but sometimes I get so caught up in the fascinating responses that I... what was the question I was supposed to ask?",

I love hearing about different jobs because it gives me ideas for future research projects! Like last month I met someone who worked in... oh, but that's not relevant right now. Focus, Marcus! What was I asking about? Your job, right?",

We have these specific ranges that the statistics software requires and... speaking of software, we just upgraded to this new analysis program and it's amazing what it can do with correlation matrices! But I'm getting ahead of myself again. Age bracket, right. Or was I asking about something else?",
        "I should probably ask about your experience with surveys and research studies. Have you participated in anything like this before? It's always interesting to see how prior experience affects responses, though I suppose that creates a bias in the data which we'd need to control for statistically... oh, I just thought of another variable we should be measuring!
